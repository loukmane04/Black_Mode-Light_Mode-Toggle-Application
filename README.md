# Black_Mode-Light_Mode-Toggle-Application
This Java Swing application provides a simple interface with a black mode and a light mode toggle. When the "black mode" button is clicked, the background of the panel turns black, and the button is replaced by a "light mode" button. Clicking the "light mode" button changes the background back to white and switches back to the "black mode" button.

# Prerequisites
